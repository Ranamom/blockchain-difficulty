PRE-1.0
----------------------------
1) add all other algorithms*
2) README update screenshot of output
3) create a release 1.0



POST-1.0
----------------------------
1) Print the results of each algorithm as soon as that goroutine has finished
- Ensure results are printed in serial instead of writing at the same time
- Consider the use of a shared channel and a single writer

2) Consider this:
- What if blocktime became 3 days?
- Currently, mining power only adjusts between blocks therefore mining power did not vary within that 3 day period

3) Make mining power changes the same for all algos running






*algorithms:
BTC
new difficulty = old difficulty *  ((2160 * 10mins) / time for last 20160)
	window configurable

ETH 
block_diff = parent_diff + parent_diff // 2048 * 
      max(1 - (block_timestamp - parent_timestamp) // 10, -99) + 
      int(2**((block.number // 100000) - 2))
window is every block, sample is every block!
	nothing configurable

ASERT
exponent = (time_delta - ideal_block_time * (height_delta + 1)) / halflife
next_target = anchor_target * 2**(exponent)
(see https://reference.cash/protocol/blockchain/proof-of-work/difficulty-adjustment-algorithm)
	halflife configurable	

DigiShield
(see https://github.com/zawy12/difficulty-algorithms/issues/7)

LWMA
linear weighted moving average
	weighting configurable?. sample size configurable.

EMA
exponential moving average
	window configurable, interval configurable

SMA
simple moving average
	window configurable, interval configurable
