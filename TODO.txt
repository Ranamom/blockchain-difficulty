PRE-1.0 ----------------------------
- testing
- create a release 1.0



POST-1.0 ----------------------------
- Consider this:
  - What if blocktime became 2 days?
  - Currently, mining power only adjusts between blocks therefore mining power did not vary within that 2 day period
- Make mining power changes the same for all algorithms running
- More configurable mining and attack simulation
- Add other algorithms:
    ASERT
        exponent = (time_delta - ideal_block_time * (height_delta + 1)) / halflife
            next_target = anchor_target * 2**(exponent)
        (see https://reference.cash/protocol/blockchain/proof-of-work/difficulty-adjustment-algorithm)
         halflife configurable	
    DigiShield
        (see https://github.com/zawy12/difficulty-algorithms/issues/7)
