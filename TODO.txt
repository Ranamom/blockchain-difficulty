CURRENT TODO
algorithms/ fix algorithms
    why does the ema/sma look at nextdifficult??
algorithms/ add algorithms

README add a screenshot of output
README add an example of tuning parameters under "configure algorithm parameters"
create a release 1.0
let zawy12 know about my project, ask for feedback
marketing? twitter, hackernews, reddit?




algorithms:
BTC
new difficulty = old difficulty *  ((2160 * 10mins) / time for last 20160)
	window configurable

ETH 
block_diff = parent_diff + parent_diff // 2048 * 
      max(1 - (block_timestamp - parent_timestamp) // 10, -99) + 
      int(2**((block.number // 100000) - 2))
window is every block, sample is every block!
	nothing configurable

ASERT
exponent = (time_delta - ideal_block_time * (height_delta + 1)) / halflife
next_target = anchor_target * 2**(exponent)
(see https://reference.cash/protocol/blockchain/proof-of-work/difficulty-adjustment-algorithm)
	halflife configurable	

DigiShield
(see https://github.com/zawy12/difficulty-algorithms/issues/7)

LWMA
linear weighted moving average
	weighting configurable. sample size configurable.

EMA
exponential moving average
	window configurable, interval configurable

SMA
simple moving average
	window configurable, interval configurable




tmp:
variance describes volatility from the mean. average of the squared differences from the mean
calculate mean
for each data point subtract the mean
square each result to get all positives
sum all these values
divide by (number of data points minus 1) i.e. 10 - 1 = 9

stddev is sqrt of variance
lower stddev = less volatility

run over a really high number of blocks like a million, for LLN and for fun

start current difficulty at 6 000 000 000
start hashpower at 1 000 000
target block time is 10 minutes(6000 seconds)

type results?

for each variable you should decide if its
global
- network
- blockchain
-algo

nextRecalc a property of the blockchain instead of the algo


run with 1 day to see zoomed in  resolution





TODO
1) Print the results of each algorithm as soon as that goroutine has finished
- Ensure results are printed in serial instead of writing at the same time
- Consider the use of a shared channel and a single writer

2) Consider this:
- What if blocktime became 3 days?
- Currently, mining power only adjusts between blocks therefore mining power did not vary within that 3 day period

3) Make mining power changes the same for all algos running
