PRE-1.0 ----------------------------
- add all other algorithms*
- create a release 1.0





POST-1.0 ----------------------------
- Consider this:
- What if blocktime became 2 days?
- Currently, mining power only adjusts between blocks therefore mining power did not vary within that 2 day period

- Make mining power changes the same for all algos running






*algorithms:
ETH 
    block_diff = parent_diff + parent_diff // 2048 * 
          max(1 - (block_timestamp - parent_timestamp) // 10, -99) + 
          int(2**((block.number // 100000) - 2))
    window is every block, sample is every block!
    nothing configurable
